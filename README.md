# Yet Another Social Share Plugin

To activate the plugin:
1. Download the .zip file from this repo.
2. Go you your Plugins>>Add New page.
3. Upload the .zip file and activate the plugin.

The plugin comes with a couple preset options, but to activate it across your site, you'll need to select "yes" in the first option. 

By default, the social sharing does not show on the homepage, unless the "float left" placement options is selected. 

You can also use the shortcode `[yass-share]` to embed social sharing links on your content.

Any questions, open an issue here, and I'd love to take a lot at it.
