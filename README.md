# Yet Another Social Share Plugin

To activate the plugin:
1. Download the .zip file from this repo.
2. Go you your Plugins>>Add New page.
3. Upload the .zip file and activate the plugin.

The plugin comes with a couple preset options, but to activate it across your site, you'll need to select "yes" in the first option. 

By default, the social sharing does not show on the homepage, unless the "float left" placement options is selected. 

You can also use the shortcode `[yass-share]` to embed social sharing links on your content.

Any questions, open an issue here, and I'd love to take a lot at it. 

This plugin was created as a special project for Toptal.

### The Assignment: Create a Social Share plugin

The goal is to create a plugin that will automatically display selected social network(s) sharing buttons in posts and/or on pages.

Support for the following social networks is required: Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Whatsapp (for mobile browsers only).

The plugin options page must include the following configurable items:

1. The choice to display on posts / pages / other registered custom post types
2. Options to activate / deactivate the buttons for different social networks
3. Three different button sizes to choose from (small / medium / large)
4. The choice to display the icons in their original colors (default) or all in a selected color
5. An option to determine in which order the icons will appear (e.g: FB - TW - G+ - etc)
6. Options to place the social share bar (one or more of these can be selected)

- a) below the post title
- b) floating on the left area
- c) after the post content
- d) inside the featured image

The plugin should also enable a shortcode to include the sharing bar inside a post content
